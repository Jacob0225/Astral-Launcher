# Astral Launcher
A game launcher which can be used as a CLI, GUI, and a library for creating and playing modrinth projects

Astral Launcher aims to provide three components:
- A library (theseus)
- A CLI (theseus-cli)
- A GUI (theseus-gui)

for right now this is a fork of Modrinth App 0.6.3 but that will change in the future
