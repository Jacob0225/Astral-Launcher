# Astral Launcher
A game launcher which can be used as a CLI, GUI, and a library for creating and playing Modrinth and possibly Curseforge projects

Astral Launcher aims to provide three components:
- A library (theseus)
- A CLI (theseus-cli)
- A GUI (theseus-gui)

### This is in Alpha and everything works (that I know of) besides the version selector which is stuck at 1.21.1 and only has older loader versons
(The Issue is the metadata I will take any help because I don't know to much about rust)
